    Redux: How Redux works
====================================================

1. Components are given callback functions as props, which they call when a UI event happens
2. Those callbacks create and dispatch actions based on the event
3. Reducers process the actions, computing the new state
4. The new state of the whole application goes into a single store.
5. Components receive the new state as props and re-render themselves where needed.

DG:
<=> Components: UI event happents
=> callbacks create and dispatch actions
=> reducers: process actions, computing new state
=> new state goes into store
=> Components: receive the new state as props
=> Components re-render themselves

    ES6: import and export
====================================================

Folder Structure:
/folder1
    red.js
    /folder2
        green.js
        blue.js
        /folder3
            white.js

#import cùng folder
import xxx from './blue'

#import khác folder
import xxx from './folder3/white'
import xxx from '../red'

#import default/not default
export default const xxx = []
export const yyy = []
export const zzz = []

import xxx from './blue'
import { yyy } from './blue'
import { yyy, zzz } from '/blue'
